### DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge

The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge seeks to simulate similar challenges in a spacecraft navigation system, emphasizing the need for accuracy in calculations.

#### Challenge Overview

This challenge invites students to debug, refactor, and enhance JavaScript functions designed for determining the trajectory of a spacecraft. The initial functions are flawed and may result in incorrect calculations.

The file structure should be organized and intuitive. It helps in locating and managing files efficiently. Clear file structure enhances collaboration among developers. Proper file structure aids in version control and deployment processes. Organized files reduce the chances of errors and improve project scalability.

#### Original Code Issues

1. Variable names were not semantic, hindering code understanding.
2. Incorrect units used in calculations may lead to inaccurate results.
3. The calcNewVelocity function was not correctly defined, causing syntax errors.
4. Lack of error handling made the code susceptible to unexpected inputs.
5. Inadequate comments or documentation may hinder code maintenance and debugging.

#### Changes Made

1. Renamed variables to ensure semantic clarity and improve code readability.
2. Implemented proper unit conversions to ensure consistent calculations.
3. Correctly defined the calcNewVelocity function with appropriate parameter handling.
4. Added error handling to handle invalid input parameters effectively.
5. Updated comments and documentation for better code understanding and maintenance.

#### Debugged Code

- The debugged code now produces accurate results with corrected calculations.
- Improved code readability and maintainability through semantic variable naming.
- Ensured robustness by incorporating error handling for invalid inputs.
- Enhanced code documentation and comments aid in understanding and future debugging.
- Unit conversions are properly implemented to maintain consistency and accuracy in calculations.

### Conclusion

With these changes and enhancements, the spacecraft navigation system is now better equipped to handle calculations accurately, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring the success of future missions.
